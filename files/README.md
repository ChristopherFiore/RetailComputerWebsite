## Simple PC's

### Introduction to the website ###

Hi, My name is Christopher Fiore and after working in the retail computer
industry for a coule of years, one major thing i have realised is that there is
a lack of correct information surrounding computers for basic use and also 
a lot of inflated prices to catch unsuspecting people off guard. That's why I
have dedicated this website to be a simple platform for students, failies or
anyone who may be less knowleadgable about their tech to get good guidance and
a good price.


### Format of the Website
                    
                                   index.html
                                       |
        ------------- ---------- ------------ ---------- --------- 
        |            |          |            |          |        |
    contact.html   pc.html  laptops.html  faq.html  login.html  cart.html


    Note: All webpages are connected by a fixed navigation bar at the top of
    the page with other various links that are highlited by pointer cursers
    and images.


### File format

I have opted to try to abstract my various css files and html files into
seperate files making it very easy for the user of my code to find where
specific elements are. style.css is the main css file, scripts.js is the main 
javascript file and index.html is the main html file. All the other file names
indicate their various purpose. e.g. 'contact.css' builds off of style.css to
implement the specific styling for the contact page.

### Javascript features

1) Feature which swaps out the images and changes the opacity of objects to
   display stats when hovering over the various PC's or Laptops
2) Feature which displays to the user when an item has been added to the cart.
   simply add anything to the cart to experience this feature.
3) Animated gifs when hovering over the computer on the index.html. stationary
   image when not hovered over which turns into an animated gif of the RGB lights
   on the computer lighting up and spinning when hovering over it. (Link to the
   PC page from this gif too).
4) Event listening for the website when resizing the width of the website. This
   listener has been carefully desgined so that it will work upon directly rezising
   into a smaller frame or by dragging it smaller. Either option will produce a
   very crisp and clean display.

### Responsiveness

All my webpages have the responsive ability to be used on a phone or tablet device
resizing all pages into the phone view results in a nice adaptive, easy to use
display. The most prolific of this being the adaptive ability of my PC's and 
Laptops page which upon resizing will drop teh two columns into a single column
of items, making it very accessible to those not accessing the website on a 
computer.
